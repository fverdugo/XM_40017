    "We can be a bit more flexible and use a buffered channel. In this case, `put!` will block only if the channel is full and `take!` will block if the channel is empty. We repeat the previous example, but with a buffered channel of size 2. Note that we can call `put!` until the channel is full. At this point, we need to wait to until we call `take!` which removes an item from the channel, making room for a new item."
